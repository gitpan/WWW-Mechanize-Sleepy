WWW::Mechanize::Sleepy
======================

INSTALLATION

Sometimes when testing the behavior of a webserver it is important to be able
to space out your requests in order to simulate a person reading, thinking (or 
sleeping) at the keyboard.

WWW::Mechanize::Sleepy subclasses WWW::Mechanize to provide pauses between your server requests.
Use it just like you would use WWW::Mechanize.

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
